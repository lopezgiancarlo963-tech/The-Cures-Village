			<h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
			<h2>Root of Withering</h2>
		</header>
		
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			<p>With an <b>18</b> on History, Brulgwyn digs deep into his knowledge, recalling old <b>dwarven
 legends</b> and <b>village stories</b> passed down through the elders.</p>
 <p>There was a <b>tale,</b> one that seemed like mere superstition in his youth—a warning
 about a blight that once spread through dwarven settlements <b>centuries ago</b>. It
	 wasn’t caused by sickness, but by <b>a forbidden magic</b>, tied to a lost <b>artifact</b>
	 known
 as the <b>Root of Withering</b>.</p>
 <p>The legend spoke of a <b>cursed root</b>, twisted by dark forces, which drained the life
 from those who dwelled near it. Villages that came into contact with it suffered <b>a
 strange affliction,</b> their bodies weakening, their veins turning black—just like what
 Brulgwyn saw in his people.</p>
 <p>The only known way to break the curse was to <b>destroy the artifact</b> or <b>seek the
 magic of an ancient healer—</b>a rare individual capable of purging such corruption.</p>
 <p>Looking at Eldrin’s book again, Brulgwyn now recognizes <b>some of the symbols and
 descriptions—</b>they match the old stories <b>exactly</b>.</p>
 <p>Eldrin wasn’t lying. This wasn’t a natural disease.</p>
 <p>Brulgwyn now knows the curse could be tied to <b>a magical source</b>, possibly the <b>Root
 of Withering</b>, or something similar.</p>
			<p>Brulgwyn’s eyes narrow, his grip tightening on the edge of the table. He leans forward,
 his deep voice rumbling with authority.</p>
			<p> “If this is a curse and not some natural sickness… then someone must’ve brought it
 upon my people.” His stare locks onto Eldrin. <b>“Who is responsible?”</b></p>
			<p> Eldrin closes the book with a slow, deliberate motion. His gaze meets Brulgwyn’s,
 unreadable yet calm. “That is the question that truly matters, isn’t it?” He lets out a
 quiet breath. “Curses do not appear without cause. Someone—or something—set this
 blight upon your village.”</p>
   <p>He steps toward the shelves, pulling down another, <b>older tome</b>. Dust scatters as he
 flips through fragile pages. “If your people suffer from a curse like the one described
 here, then it could have only come from a source of power. A relic… or a wielder of
 dark magic.”</p>
			<p> His finger stops on a <b>crude drawing</b> of a gnarled, <b>twisted root</b>, its tendrils
 spreading like veins. <b>The Root of Withering.</b>“There is one place such an object could have been unearthed.” He looks up at
 Brulgwyn. <b>“The Ruins of Black Hollow.”</b></p>
			<p>The name stirs something in Brulgwyn’s memory. Black Hollow was an abandoned
 dwarven settlement long lost to history, said to be swallowed by shadow centuries
 ago</p>
<p> Eldrin closes the book. “If you wish to find who is responsible, you must start there.”</p>
