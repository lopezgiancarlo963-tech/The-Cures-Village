			<h1>CHAPTER 7</h1>
			<h2>The Emerald Vale</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			<p> With his supplies in hand, Brulgwyn sets out from the town, the familiar roads of
 civilization fading behind him. The <b>sun begins to dip</b>, casting a warm golden glow
 over the landscape as he heads <b>east</b>, toward the <b>Emerald Vale</b>.</p>
			<p>As he walks, the terrain shifts, becoming <b>more rugged and wild</b>. The path ahead
 narrows, winding through <b>forests of towering oaks</b> and <b>distant hills</b>.</p>
			<p>Brulgwyn crosses a few <b>small streams</b> and notices the air growing thick with the
 scent of <b>damp earth</b> and <b>fresh pine</b>. As the day wears on, the dense woods around
 him begin to feel <b>less welcoming,</b> and the path seems to change before his very
 eyes, twisting in unexpected directions.</p>
			<p>After traveling for several hours, <b>the shadows lengthen</b>, and Brulgwyn finds a <b>small
 clearing</b> where he can rest. As he settles down to take a break, he hears the sound of
 <b>whispering winds</b> rustling through the trees. It's as if the forest itself is alive,
 <b>watching.</b></p>
			<strong><p> The journey toward the Emerald Vale will not be easy.
 Brulgwyn must now:</p></strong>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Continue walking through the night,</b> pushing onward, even with the eerie
 feeling in the air.</li>
				<li><b>Set up camp and rest,</b> regaining strength for the next day’s travel.</li>
				<li><b>Investigate the strange whispers,</b> feeling the urge to follow them or discover
 their source.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Brulgwyn finds a sheltered spot beneath a thick-boughed tree, where moss cushions
 the forest floor. He sets up a small camp—arranging stones for a firepit, laying out his
 bedroll, and lighting a modest fire to ward off the cold and anything with too much
 curiosity.</p>
			<p>As the flames crackle and shadows dance along the trees, the forest quiets… but not
 completely. The whispering wind returns<b>—softer now,</b> like a lullaby sung in a
 language long forgotten. It doesn’t feel hostile… just <b>ancient,</b> and perhaps…
 <b>watchful.</b></p>
			<p>Brulgwyn stills his breath and listens, allowing the rhythm of the forest to speak. He
 notices that the whispering isn't just wind—it’s a <b>natural phenomenon tied to the
 enchantments of the Emerald Vale.</b> The forest isn’t cursed, but <b>awakened.</b> It
 watches over those who enter, deciding if they are worthy to pass.</p>
			<p>The whispers aren’t words—they're feelings: <b>curiosity, caution, and a faint
 invitation.</b> Brulgwyn senses he is being <b>tested</b>... but not threatened. The forest wants to <b>understand his intent.</b></p>
			<p>With that knowledge, the fire’s glow seems warmer, and the surrounding darkness less
 hostile.</p>
			<p>He speaks into the night with a low, rumbling voice, telling the forest of his <b>village’s
 suffering,</b> of the <b>mysterious flu,</b> and his quest to find a cure. The words are rough,
 lacking polish—but they carry <b>truth</b> and <b>loyalty</b>.</p>
			<p>The forest doesn’t respond with words. But the wind stills. The whispers fade. And for
 a brief moment, the trees <b>lean ever so slightly away,</b> as if parting for him. It’s not
 full acceptance, but <b>acknowledgment.</b></p>
			<p>Brulgwyn feels the tension in the air lessen. He settles into his bedroll, the fire
 crackling softly, and this time, <b>no whispers disturb him.</b></p>
			<hr>
			<p> <b>Brulgwyn gains the benefit of a full long rest.</b>
 He wakes at dawn, the morning mist swirling gently through the trees.</p>
			<p>With the morning sun filtering through the misty canopy, Brulgwyn shoulders his pack
 and presses onward into the heart of the enchanted forest. </p>
			<p>The path, while still winding and mystical, seems <b>clearer</b> than before<b>—as though
 the forest has granted him passage,</b> at least for now. The air is rich with the scent
 of damp moss, blooming wildflowers, and the hum of unseen magic.</p>
			<p> As Brulgwyn walks, he notices:</p>
			<lu>
				<li>Small <b>animal tracks</b> alongside the path—foxes, perhaps, or something smaller.</li>
				<li>Strange <b>luminescent fungi</b> glowing faintly beneath the shade of large ferns.</li>
				<li><b>Butterflies with shimmering wings</b> that seem to disappear mid-flutter, only to reappear ahead, always drifting in the same direction.</li>
				</lu>
			<p> After about an hour of walking, the forest opens slightly into a <b>sun-dappled glade</b>. In
 the center stands a <b>crystal-clear pool</b>, surrounded by stone ruins—half-sunken and
 overgrown, with <b>runes etched into their surfaces.</b></p>
			<p>Near the edge of the pool, Brulgwyn spots a <b>figure cloaked in moss-green robes,</b>
 kneeling by the water, whispering softly to it. Elven in appearance… perhaps someone
 tied to the Vale?</p>
			<p> Brulgwyn steps forward slowly, keeping his weapon sheathed and his voice calm. The
 soft crunch of leaves under his boots echoes gently through the glade as he
 approaches the figure.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>He speaks:</dt>
 <dd><b>“Hail, traveler. I seek no quarrel. My name is Brulgwyn Burrowbranch. I’m on
 a quest to save my village from a cursed flu. I was told the Emerald Vale
 might hold answers… or someone who can help.”</b></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The cloaked figure pauses. Then slowly rises.</p>
			<p> She turns, revealing <b>an elven woman</b>, her eyes like <b>liquid silver</b>, her hair woven
 with tiny flowers that seem to bloom as she moves. She regards Brulgwyn for a long
 moment—then nods.</p>
			<dl>
				<dd><i><b>““You speak with truth,”</b> she says, her voice like wind through harp string.</i></dd>
 <dd><i><b>“I am Vaelora, the Last Light… keeper of the Vale’s healing arts.”</b></i></dd>
			</dl>
			<p><i>She walks toward him, barefoot and unhindered by the bramble.
 <b>“Your people suf fer from a deep-rooted curse—one I have sensed from
 afar. But to cure it, we must uncover the source. You will need something
 powerful. And dangerous.””</b></i></p>
			<p>She gestures to the pool, where images ripple across the surface<b>—a blackened root,dying trees, and a stone altar beneath a mountain.</b></p>
			<p><b><i> ““You seek the Root of Withering. An ancient artifact buried in the ruins of
 Black Hollow… a place once ruled by your kind.”
 “Bring it to me, and I may yet save your people.””</i></b></p>
			<p>Brulgwyn furrows his brow, trying to recall any old tales from the hearth fires of his
 youth—songs of ancient dwarven cities, lost relics, or whispers of the Root of</p>
			<p>Withering. But… nothing solid comes to mind. The name Black Hollow stirs unease,
 but not clarity. It's as if the <b>memories were buried</b> with the ruins themselves.</p>
			<p>Vaelora watches him quietly, understanding the burden of forgotten history.</p>
			<dd><b><i>““It is no fault of yours,”</i></b> <i>she says gently.</i>
 <b><i>“The Hollow lies far to the south, in the shadow of the Stoneveil
 Mountains. Many who go near it report… silence. Not just quiet—true
 silence, where even thought feels muffled. It is a place touched by ancient
 sorrow.””</i></b></dd>
			<p>She reaches into her robe and offers Brulgwyn a <b>small vial of glowing amber
 liquid.</b></p>
			<dd><i><b> ““A draught of protection. Drink it only when you feel the shadow of the
 Hollow pressing in. It may not save you, but it will buy you time.””</b></i></dd>
			<p><b>You receive: Elixir of Warding Shadows</b></p>
 <dd><i>(One use. Advantage on Wisdom saving throws and resistance to necrotic damage for
 1 hour.)</i></dd>
			<p>Brulgwyn bows his head respectfully, gripping the vial tightly in his hand.</p>
			<bb><i><b>““Thank you, Lady Vaelora. I owe you much. When I return, it will be with
 the Root... and hope for my people.””</b></i></bb>
			<p> Vaelora gives a faint smile—more solemn than joyful—and steps back toward the
 shimmering pool.</p>
			<bb><i><b>““Go with strength, Brulgwyn Burrowbranch. The Hollow does not
 welcome the living… but it may yet listen to the brave.””</b></i></bb>
			<p>With that, the trees seem to <b>part once more,</b> guiding the dwarf southward through
 the Vale.</p>
