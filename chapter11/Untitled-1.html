			<h1>CHAPTER 11</h1>
			<h2>Root Of Withering</h2>
			</header>
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn narrows his eyes and approaches the pulsing Root of Withering,
 examining it carefully under the flickering torchlight. With steady hands, he circles the
 stone dais, looking for signs of traps, magical runes, or structural weakness.</p>
 <p>Though the Root itself is gnarled and veined with dark energy, nothing around it
 appears trapped or warded in the traditional sense. No glyphs, no arcane symbols, no
 mechanical triggers.</p>
<p> However… with your <b>Investigation roll of 11,</b> Brulgwyn notices something odd: the
 stone beneath the Root is cracked<b>—but not from time or pressure.</b>It looks as
 though the <b>Root forced its way up from below,</b> growing unnaturally into the
 chamber like a parasite.</p>
 <p>There’s a faint <b>thrum of energy</b> in the air, almost like a heartbeat—slow, heavy, and
 ancient. You suspect the Root is more than just a cursed object. It’s alive in some
 twisted sense.</p>
			<p> You don’t detect a physical trap—but the danger may be <b>spiritual or magical.</b> <br>The Hollow watches.</p>		
			<p> Brulgwyn grips the <b>amulet of Thramdor</b> once more and kneels before the twisted,
 pulsing Root. He bows his head, murmuring a solemn prayer—not to command, but to
 <i>understand:</i></p>
 <p><i>““O Hammer-Father, guide my hand… Is this curse born of the gods, or something
 <br>fouler still?””</i></p>
 <p>With a total <b>Religion check of 10,</b> Brulgwyn doesn't receive a clear answer—no
 visions, no divine voice. But in the stillness, he feels a subtle <i>wrongness</i> radiating from
 the Root. It doesn’t feel like it came from any god of his people—not even one known
 for wrath.</p>
 <p>This Root is not divine<b>... but it has been touched by something beyond mortal
 reach.</b> A corruption deeper than blight. Not unholy, but <b>forgotten—</b>a remnant of
 something <b>older</b> than the gods Brulgwyn worships. Perhaps something buried for
 good reason.</p>
			<p>Still, it's clear: <b>the Root is not evil by nature,</b> but it has become a vessel for
 something foul. Its power may yet be used… or cleansed.</p>
			
			<p>With a roll of <b>12,</b> Brulgwyn takes a deep breath and steadies his focus, his mind
 sharpening as he taps into his knowledge of the arcane. He inspects the Root of
 Withering with careful attention to its <b>magical resonance.</b></p>
 
			<p>The faint pulsing glow and <b>vibrations</b> emanating from the Root have a distinct
 <b>magical signature,</b> but not one of simple necromancy or nature magic. Instead, it's a <b>twisted form of primal energy,</b> as if the Root has absorbed the power of <b>decay
 and rebirth,</b> both at once.</p> 
			
			<p>Brulgwyn deduces that the Root is a <b>focal point of cursed magic,</b> but not
 necessarily evil in its intent. It’s been warped by <b>years of misuse—</b>perhaps originally
 a symbol of healing, corrupted by some ancient ritual. The Root likely has the power to
 either <b>heal or kill—</b>its potency lies in its <b>connection to life’s cycle</b> but is currently
 dominated by death.</p>

			<p>The energy within it could be <b>channeled for good,</b> if properly handled, or could
 cause even greater <b>harm</b> if left unchecked.<br>The Hollow grows quiet, waiting for Brulgwyn's next move.</p>
			
			<p>With a <b>Medicine roll of 9,</b> Brulgwyn studies the <b>Root of Withering,</b> trying to assess
 its properties as he would a wounded creature. He presses his hand against the
 darkened surface, trying to feel for any signs of life or any ability to heal the ill.</p>
 
			<p>However, he feels nothing of typical vitality—no warmth or pulse of life as one would
 expect from a living organism. Instead, there’s a faint chill, a sense of <b>sapping
 energy,</b> as though it’s slowly draining the life from its surroundings. The Root doesn’t
 seem to carry the healing potential he hoped for; instead, it feels like an <b>unnatural
 force of decay.</b></p>
			
 <p>Still, Brulgwyn cannot completely rule out that there may be a way to <b>reverse</b> its
 effects through the right method, such as purification or divine intervention.</p>
			<p>his clan had passed down through generations, a prayer for purification and
 protection.</p>
 
			<i><p>““Hammer-Father, guide my hands. Restore what has been twisted. Heal the broken
 and bring light where darkness reigns.””</p></i>
 
			<p>He draws the amulet close to the Root, focusing all his energy into channeling
 Thramdor’s power through the amulet and his own spirit. The torchlight flickers, and
 the air in the chamber grows heavy. The <b>crackling energy</b> of the Root seems to
 respond, almost as if it’s alive, twisting and fighting against the ritual’s purifying
 forces.</p>
 
			<p>Brulgwyn's prayer reverberates through the chamber, and slowly, the <b>shadowy
 tendrils</b> of decay retreat, as though repelled by the divine energy. The pulsing slows,
 and the air seems to brighten slightly. The Root's dark power is still present, but for
 now, it has been <b>momentarily cleansed,</b> and the chamber feels less oppressive.</p>
 
			<p>However, it’s clear the Root's curse is not fully gone. It will need a <b>stronger, more
 potent ritual,</b> possibly even a direct intervention from a high-level cleric or another
 powerful being to fully rid it of its curse.</p>

			<p>For now, Brulgwyn has bought himself some time, and the air feels fresher and less
 stifling.</p>
			<p> Brulgwyn raises his torch and steps slowly around the chamber, letting the flickering
 light reveal more of the forgotten carvings, cracks, and shadows lingering in the room.
 Dust hangs in the air like mist, and the faint hum of arcane energy brushes against his
 senses.</p>
			<strong><p> Here's what he observes as he examines the chamber more closely:</p></strong>
			
			<ul>
			<li><b>To the left,</b> behind a cracked column, he finds <b>a faded dwarven mural</b> partially
 eroded. It depicts a <b>ritual circle</b> with several dwarves gathered around a glowing
 root—uncorrupted. One figure in the mural holds a <b>chalice,</b> another wields <b>a
 warhammer</b> similar to Brulgwyn’s.</li><br>
				
				<li><b> To the right,</b> there’s a <b>stone slab altar</b> with dried remnants of herbs, wax, and
 ash—evidence that rituals were once performed here, perhaps even purification rites. A <b>small groove</b> in the altar’s surface suggests it was used to <b>channel
 liquid,</b> likely from a sacred vessel.</li><br>
				
				<li> And just past the altar, nearly hidden behind hanging roots, Brulgwyn notices a
 <b>narrow passageway</b> partially blocked by rubble. It's just wide enough for a dwarf
 to squeeze through with effort.</li>
				</ul>
		<p>Brulgwyn grips his warhammer tightly, then slings it across his back as he turns to the
 narrow, rubble-choked passageway. The air here is colder, stiller—as if whatever lies
 beyond hasn’t been disturbed in centuries. Twisting his shoulders, he begins to <b>pull
 away the debris,</b> stone by stone.</p>	
			
			<p>As Brulgwyn strains against the pile of collapsed stone, a large slab shifts<b>—then slips
 suddenly.</b> He leaps back just in time to avoid being crushed, but the effort <b>exhausts
 his arms</b> and leaves the rubble even more tangled than before. A cold breeze creeps
 through the crack in the stones, carrying with it the scent of ancient earth... and
 something fouler.</p>
			
			<p> Brulgwyn takes a step back from the blocked passage, steadying his breath and
 letting his eyes adjust to the dim, flickering light of the torch. He scans the chamber
 carefully, his dwarven instincts honed from years in the stone halls</p>
			
			<p>Near the <b>left side of the rubble,</b> he notices a <b>discolored patch of stone,</b> slightly
 sunken compared to the rest of the wall. Upon closer inspection, he sees faint tool
 marks<b>—a hidden seam,</b> suggesting this isn’t just a pile of collapsed debris… but
 possibly <b>a concealed stone door</b> that was deliberately sealed.</p>
		
			<p> It’s tight, but with the right mechanism—or enough force—it might open.</p>	
	<p>Brulgwyn squares his stance, gripping the edges of the hidden door with his calloused
 fingers. The cold stone resists him, but so few things ever stand long against a
 determined dwarf.</p>
