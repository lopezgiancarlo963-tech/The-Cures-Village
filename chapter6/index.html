		<h1>CHAPTER 6</h1>
		<h2>Lady Vaelora</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
		
			<hr>
			<p>With an <b>18</b> on History, Brulgwyn recalls old tales of <b>Lady Vaelora, the Last Light.</b></p>
			<p>She was once a <b>renowned elven healer</b>, known for wielding magic that could <b>purge
 even the most cursed afflictions</b>. Some believed she was blessed by the gods,
 while others whispered that her power came from something <b>older than divinity
 itself</b>.</p>
			<p>Long ago, she vanished into the <b>Emerald Vale,</b> a mystical land hidden within an
 enchanted forest. <b>Few who seek her ever return,</b> and those who do speak of
 <b>illusions, shifting paths, and unseen watchers</b> that guard her domain. Some say
 that only the truly desperate—or the truly worthy—can find their way to her sanctuary.</p>
			<strong><p>Brulgwyn now understands:</p></strong>
<ul>
<li>Lady Vaelora is <b>real</b>, but reaching her is a <b>great challenge</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>Emerald Vale is heavily enchanted</b>, making it difficult to navigate.</li>
<li>If she <b>still lives</b>, she may be one of the few capable of breaking the curse.</li>
</ul>
			<strong><p>Now, Brulgwyn must decide:</p></strong>
			<ol>
			 <li><b>Go to Black Hollow</b>—confront the source of the curse head-on and try to destroy
 the Root of Withering.</li>
				<li><b>Seek Lady Vaelora—</b>risk the enchanted forest in search of a powerful healer</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Brulgwyn nods, determination in his eyes. <b>“I will find Lady Vaelora. If she knows
 anything about curing this curse, I must seek her out.”</b></p>
			<p>Eldrin inclines his head.<b> “A wise choice, but not an easy one.”</b> He unrolls a <b>faded
 map</b>, tracing a path leading eastward beyond the mountains. “The <b>Emerald Vale lies
 past the Silver Rivers,</b> hidden within the heart of the <b>Elderwood</b>. But be warned—
 the forest does not welcome outsiders. <b>Its paths shift, its trees whisper, and
 those who enter without purpose may never leave.”</b></p>
<p> He closes the map and hands it to Brulgwyn. <b>“Travel east through the valley,
 cross the Silver Rivers, and seek the archway of ancient stone. If the
 legends are true, the Vale lies beyond. But tread carefully—this is a land of
 magic, and it does not suffer fools.”</b></p>
			<ol>
			<li><b> Gather supplies in town before departing.</b></li>
			<li><b> Set off immediately toward the Emerald Vale.</b></li>
				<li><b>Ask Eldrin for any magical wards or knowledge that might help navigate
 the enchanted forest.</b></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Brulgwyn sets off back toward town, his heavy boots thudding against the dirt road.
 The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows as he nears the bustling <b>market
 district.</b> Merchants call out their wares, and the scent of roasted meat and fresh
 bread fills the air</p>
			<p>Brulgwyn takes stock of his <b>206 gold pieces (GP)</b> and considers what he might need
 for the journey ahead.</p>
			<strong><p>Shop available:</p></strong>
			<ol>
			<li><b>General Store –</b> Offers rations, rope, torches, and other travel essentials.</li>
				<li><b>Blacksmith –</b> Sells weapons, armor, and repair services.</li>
				<li> <b>Alchemist's Shop –</b> Carries potions and herbal remedies.</li>
				<li> <b>Magic Emporium –</b> Sells enchanted items and trinkets (if Brulgwyn can afford
 them).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Brulgwyn strides into the <b>blacksmith’s shop,</b> the air thick with the scent of burning
 coal and hot iron. The rhythmic clang of hammer on metal rings through the forge,
 where a burly dwarf with a braided beard wipes sweat from his brow.</p>
			<p><b>“Ah, a fellow kin!”</b> the blacksmith grins, setting down his hammer. <b>“Lookin’ to arm
 yerself proper, eh? Got plenty o’ fine steel here.”</b></p>
		<strong><p>Weapons Available:</p></strong>
			<ol>
			<li> <b>Battleaxe (15 GP) –</b> A sturdy, well-crafted axe with a keen edge.</li>
				<li> <b>Greatsword (50 GP) –</b>A massive two-handed blade, ideal for cleaving foes in
 half.</li>
				<li><b>Warhammer (20 GP) –</b> A solid dwarven hammer, perfect for smashing through
 armor.</li>
				<li><b>Handaxe (5 GP each) –</b> A lightweight, one-handed throwing axe.</li>
				<li><b>Dwarven Greataxe (80 GP) –</b> A masterwork weapon, finely balanced and
 engraved with ancient runes.</li>
				</ol>
		<p> The blacksmith eyes Brulgwyn. <b>“Or, if ye got somethin’ that needs fixin’ or
 reforgin’, I can do that too.”</b></p>
			<p> Brulgwyn currently has <b>206 GP</b>. What will he purchase, or does he have any weapons
 he’d like repaired?</p>
			<p>The <b>Warhammer</b> deals <b>1d8 bludgeoning damage</b> when wielded in one hand and
 <b>1d10 bludgeoning damage</b> when wielded in two hands (versatile).</p>
			<p> It’s great for smashing through armor and is especially effective against skeletons or
 heavily armored foes! Would Brulgwyn like to purchase it, or does he want to check
 out other weapons?</p>
			<p>The <b>Warhammer</b> costs <b>20 GP</b>.</p>
			<img src="warhammer_01.jpg" alt="warhammer" width="1171" height="722">
			<p>If Brulgwyn purchases it, he will have <b>186 GP remaining</b>. Would you like to proceed
 with the purchase?</p>
			<p>In<b> Dungeons &#38; Dragons, 1 Platinum Piece (PP) = 10 Gold Pieces (GP)</b>. So <b>20
 PP = 200 GP,</b> which is far more than the <b>20 GP</b> cost of the Warhammer.</p>
			<p>The blacksmith’s eyes widen as Brulgwyn places <b>20 Platinum Pieces</b> on the counter.
 He chuckles, scratching his beard.</p>
			<p><b>“By Moradin’s beard, lad! This hammer’s good, but it ain’t worth a king’s
 ransom!”</b> He slides back <b>18 Platinum Pieces</b> and takes just <b>2 PP (equal to 20
 GP).</b></p>
			<p>Brulgwyn now has:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Warhammer (1d8 / 1d10 Bludgeoning, Versatile)</b></li>
			<li><b>Remaining Gold: 18 Platinum (180 GP) + 6 GP</b></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The blacksmith nods in approval. <b>“A fine choice! She’ll serve ye well, dwarf.
 Anything else ye need?”</b></p>
			<p>Brulgwyn heads over to the <b>general store,</b> a cozy shop filled with all the essentials
 for travel. Shelves are stacked with dried meats, sacks of grains, bundles of rope, and
 other adventuring supplies. A middle-aged woman with a friendly smile stands behind
 the counter.</p>
			<p><b>“Ah, what can I get for you today, sir?”</b> she asks, glancing at Brulgwyn’s battle
worn appearance.</p>
			<strong><p>Available Supplies:</p></strong>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Rations (5 SP each) –</b> A 1-day serving of dried meat, bread, and cheese.</li>
				<li><b>Trail Rations (1 GP each) –</b> Compact rations for longer journeys, lightweight and filling.</li>
				<li><b>Water Skin (2 GP) –</b> Holds enough water for several days.</li>
				<li> <b>Rope (10 GP) – </b>50 feet of hempen rope, always useful.</li>
				<li> <b>Torches (1 CP each) –</b> Good for lighting the way.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Brulgwyn currently has <b>6 GP and 18 Platinum Pieces</b> (which is 180 GP).</p>
			<p>Brulgwyn hands over <b>2 GP</b> for the <b>Water Skin</b>. The shopkeeper nods, handing him
 the item with a smile. <b>"A wise purchase, traveler. You'll need it on the road."</b></p>
			<p>With his <b>Water Skin</b> now in hand and <b>3 GP and 1 Electrum Piece (4 GP)</b>
 remaining, Brulgwyn is almost ready to head out.</p>
