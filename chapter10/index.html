			<h1>CHAPTER 10</h1>
			<h2>The Stone Door</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
	
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn steps forward, gripping the <b>Root-shaped carving</b> in his calloused hand.
 The torchlight flickers across the ancient stone door, casting long shadows over the
 worn dwarven script.</p>
			<p>With a steady breath, he places the Root into the small, hollow depression at the
 center of the door.</p>
			<p><i>Click.</i></p>
			<p> The sound echoes like a hammer striking an anvil.</p>
			<p>The runes on the door flare to life<b>—soft amber light pulses outward,</b> and the entire
 stone surface begins to shift with ancient magic. Dust and time peel away as the doorslowly rumbles open, revealing a narrow stairwell descending deeper into the
 mountain.</p>
			<p> From within comes a sudden rush of <b>cold air,</b> carrying with it the scent of earth,
 decay… and <b>something old and powerful.</b></p>
			<p>But there is no turning back now.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>A solid roll, Brulgwyn. (15 + 3 = 18) — that's a very sharp eye and seasoned instinct
 at work. </p>
			<p>As you survey the doorway and descending passage, you pick up on several important
 details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> The<b> first few steps</b>are slick with moisture—likely condensation from deeper
 below. You adjust your footing accordingly.</li>
				<li>On the <b>left wall,</b> faint scratch marks<i>—claw-like—</i>hint that something has climbed
 out of this passage before.</li>
				<li>Near the <b>floor ahead,</b> you notice subtle grooves<b>—a pressure plate</b> likely linked
 to a trap. Without your careful scan, it would’ve triggered.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>You carefully bypass it, marking the edge with a bit of chalk from your pack.</p>
			<p> Most importantly, you get the <b>impression that you’re being watched—</b>not actively
 threatened, but observed... evaluated.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Brulgwyn tightens his grip on the haft of his newly acquired <b>warhammer,</b> its polished
 head gleaming dully in the torchlight. The carved handle fits snugly in his calloused
 hands—an extension of his will and his wrath.</p>
			<p> With quiet, deliberate steps, he begins the descent into the <b>depths of Black Hollow.</b>
 The air grows colder, and the stone walls close in around him. The only sounds are the
 distant drip of water and the faint whisper of something ancient shifting below.</p>
			<p> As you descend, your torchlight flickers across <b>dwarven murals,</b> cracked and faded:
 proud halls, blazing forges, and finally—scenes of <b>darkness creeping in</b>. Shadows
 overtaking light. One final image: a <b>great tree,</b> with blackened roots choking a
 golden heart.</p>
			<p> Eventually, the stairway opens into a wide underground <b>chamber</b>. Pillars line the
 walls, many cracked or toppled. In the center stands a <b>stone dais—</b>and upon it,
 something faintly glowing, pulsing like a slow heartbeat…</p>
			<p>Brulgwyn has entered the <b>Hollow Heart.</b></p>
			<p> But he’s not alone.</p>
			<p>A low growl echoes through the chamber. From the shadows behind a column, two
 <b>twisted, spectral dwarves</b> emerge—ghostly, with glowing eyes and rusted armor
 fused to their undead forms. One raises a blackened axe. The other points at you.</p>
			<img src="ghostly dwaft_01.jpg" alt="ghostly dwfat" width="1180" height="777">
			<p><i> ““You do not belong here,” they rasp. “Turn back, or be judged like the rest.””</i></p>
			<p>Brulgwyn steps forward with firm resolve, lifting the <b>amulet of Thramdor</b> high above
 his head. The dwarven runes etched into its surface catch the torchlight, casting faint
 silver reflections across the chamber.</p>
			<p>His voice echoes with both authority and reverence:</p>
			<img src="green emulate_01.jpg" id="B" alt="amulat" width="644" height="659">
			<p><i>““By<b> Thramdor,</b> Hammer-Father and Guardian of the Deep Halls, I walk these
 stones not in greed, but in duty! My kin suffer, cursed by rot and shadow—I seek
 the Root not for power, but for salvation!””</i></p>
			<p> The spectral dwarves freeze.</p>
			<p>For a tense moment, silence stretches across the chamber—until the amulet begins to
 <b>glow with soft golden light.</b> The undead figures recoil slightly, eyes narrowing.</p>
			<b> Then, one lowers his axe. His voice shifts, no longer hostile—just… tired.</b>
			<p><i> ““The oath still echoes… the vow still burns. If your heart is true, and your hammer
 strikes for the living... pass, kin-blooded. But know this: the Root does not yield easily. It hungers. It remembers.””</i></p>
			<p> The spirits <b>fade into mist,</b> their duty fulfilled—for now.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The chamber is now still. At the center, the stone dais holds a <b>twisting mass of
 blackened root,</b> pulsing faintly. This must be it—the <b>Root of Withering.</b> The cursed
 source.</p>
			<p> But as Brulgwyn steps closer… he feels something stir within the Root. A presence.
 <br>Watching. Waiting.<br></p>
