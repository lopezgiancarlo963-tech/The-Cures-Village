	<h1> CHAPTER 1</h1>
	<h2>The Sick Town </h2>
	</header>
	<hr>

	<main>
<p>Bulgwyn Burrowbranch trudges through the muddy dark streets of <b>Grimhold</b>, a dreary
 town nestled between jagged mountains. The air is thick with the scent of damp wood and roasting meat, but beneath it lingers something foul—sickness, desperation. The people here are gaunt, their eyes wary, as if they’ve seen too much.</p>
	
	<img src="The village.jpg" alt="The village" width="1354" height="800">
	
 <p>Rumors led you here. A healer, an old apothecary by the name of <b>Eldrin Thornbrew</b>,
 is said to know of rare herbs with curative properties. But he’s not easy to find. The
 townsfolk speak of him in hushed whispers, some shaking their heads as if you’re
 chasing a ghost.</p>
 
	<p>You stand in the heart of Grimhold, near a rowdy tavern, a bustling market, and a
 quiet alley where a hunched figure watches you from the shadows.
 </p>
	
	<p>Brulgwyn scans the town carefully, focusing on clues about Eldrin Thornbrew. He
 notices that while most townsfolk avoid the topic, an old woman at the market is
 selling dried herbs—some of which look unfamiliar. Her stall is worn, the wooden sign
 barely hanging on by a nail.</p>
 
	<p>As Brulgwyn watches, he catches sight of a small symbol carved into the side of her
 stall<b>—a thorny vine wrapped around a crescent moon</b>. Something about it feels
 important.
 The hunched figure in the alley is still watching you.</p>
 
	<p>Brulgwyn steps into the shadowed alley, his boots splashing through puddles of filth.
 The hunched figure straightens slightly as he approaches, revealing a wiry man
 wrapped in tattered brown cloaks. His eyes, sharp and restless, flick over Brulgwyn
 like he’s sizing him up.</p>
 
	<p>"You ain't from 'round here," the man mutters, his voice raspy. "And you're lookin’ for
 somethin’."</p>
 
	<p>His fingers twitch as if expecting coin, or perhaps ready to bolt.</p>
	
	<p>Brulgwyn offers the man <b>1 Silver</b> and <b>1 Copper—</b>a small but fair gesture for
 information in this rough town. The man looks down at the coins in your hand, then
 back up at you, his eyes narrowing slightly.
 "Not enough to get me to talk... but maybe enough for a little hint," he says with a
 crooked smile. "You’re lookin’ for Eldrin Thornbrew, eh? Well, he ain’t easy to find. You
 wanna know where he is, you’ll need somethin’ more than pocket change."
 He holds up a dirty hand, waiting for something more substantial.</p>
	
	<p>With an <b>18</b> on your Insight check, Brulgwyn can tell that the man is being cautious but
 not entirely dishonest. He’s likely trying to avoid danger or get a bit more from you.
 There’s a certain desperation in his eyes, though, indicating that he might have the
 information you need—he’s just testing how far you’re willing to go.</p>
 
	<p>It seems like he’s trying to avoid conflict, but the coins alone aren’t enough to get him
 talking</p>
	
	<p>Brulgwyn turns on his heel, stepping out of the alley and back into the bustling town.
 The figure doesn’t make a move to stop him, and the tense atmosphere fades behind
 him.</p>
 
	<p>Now, with no clear lead from the mysterious figure, Brulgwyn is left to consider his
 next move. He still has the symbol on the old woman’s stall to investigate, and
 perhaps other townsfolk may have more to share.</p>
	
	<p>Brulgwyn makes his way back to the market, approaching the old woman’s stall. Her
 weathered face barely shifts as she looks up at him, her gnarled fingers pulling at
 bundles of dried herbs.</p>
 
	<p>“Back again, eh?” she says in a raspy voice, her eyes scanning his frame, as though
 sizing up his purpose. “You’ve seen the symbol, haven’t you?”</p>
 
	<p>She leans closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. “It’s the mark of <b>Eldrin
 Thornbrew.</b> Not many know about him, and fewer still would trust him. But he’s your
 best bet if you’re looking for a cure. He keeps to the woods outside town, far from the
 prying eyes of those who come looking for him. If you’re brave enough, you’ll find him
 there.”</p>
 
	<p>She pauses for a moment, then adds, “But... be careful. There’s more than just herbs
 in those woods. People come back... different.”</p>
	
	<p>With a <b>7</b> on your History check, Brulgwyn doesn't recall any specific stories or details
 about Eldrin Thornbrew or the woods beyond the general warning. The town’s history
 doesn't mention much about the apothecary or the dangerous woods he resides in,
 and the name <b>Eldrin Thornbrew</b> seems to be mostly whispered among those in the
 know.</p>

	<p> It seems you're left with the information the old woman has given you, which is still
 valuable</p>
