			<h1>CHAPTER 14</h1>
			<h2>Failed Ritual</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p>Brulgwyn had used the sacred vial and attempted a ritual to purify the Root of
 Withering. The effort strained his mind and spirit, leaving him weakened—but not
 defeated. The curse was not fully cleansed, but its corruption had been delayed. Now,
 deep in the Hollow Heart of the ruins, flickers of pale green light pulse faintly from the
 partially purified root.</p>
			
			<p>Before him, the chamber is quiet—too quiet. The ancient dwarven symbols carved into
 the walls glow faintly, and the air hums with buried power. There is a narrow corridor
 to the right, newly revealed when the ritual pulse passed through the room like a
 heartbeat.</p>
			
			<h3> Brulgwyn’s current state:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Slightly exhausted from the ritual</li><br>
				<li> Last Elixir of Warding Shadows used</li><br>
				<li>The Root is partially purified but unstable</li><br>
				<li> Carrying the amulet of Thramdor and warhammer</li><br>
				<li> Investigate the new corridor?</li><br>
				<li>Rest and recover?</li><br>
				<li>Examine the ritual space for any clues or items left behind?</li>
			</ul>
			<p> With an <b>Arcana check of 15,</b> Brulgwyn focuses on the residual energies pulsing
 faintly in the chamber. The air carries a subtle hum—an echo of magic still active, but
 changed. The purification ritual, while incomplete, has <b>weakened the Root of
 Withering’s hold,</b> muting the corruption that once saturated the walls.</p>
			<p>You sense that:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li> The <b>vial you used</b> resonated with ancient elven enchantments, likely tied to Lady
 Vaelora’s lineage.</li><br>
				<li> The <b>magic is unstable,</b> and if left too long, the Root may reawaken.</li><br>
				<li> A final sealing ritual or <b>divine catalyst—</b>perhaps involving <i>a relic or direct
 blessing from Thramdor</i>—could end the curse for good.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Faint etchings on the stone floor now glow dimly. They form a <b>sigil of Thramdor,</b>
 pointing to a deeper sanctum beyond the cracked door to the south.</p>
			
			<p> Brulgwyn grips his warhammer and steps carefully toward the sigil, torchlight
 flickering off ancient stone. The glowing rune pulses faintly with each step he takes, as
 if recognizing the presence of the amulet of Thramdor at his chest. As he crosses the
 threshold, the cracked stone door creaks open—unbidden—and reveals a spiraling
 descent into the <b>Sanctum of the Hollow Heart.</b></p>
			
		<p> The air grows colder. Carvings along the walls depict the <b>fall of Black Hollow—</b>
 dwarves succumbing to shadow, roots tangling through stone, and a final desperate
 plea to their god. At the base of the spiral, Brulgwyn finds a <b>massive chamber,</b>
 shaped like a heart split by a jagged fissure. At its center rests a <b>twisted root
 throne,</b> where a shriveled dwarven figure slumps—eyes glowing with a faint,
 unnatural light.</p>
			
			<p> The figure slowly raises its head and speaks in a rasping voice:</p>
			
			<p><i>“"You carry Thramdor’s light... yet this place is bound to rot and sorrow. Speak,
 dwarf—do you come to banish me... or to understand me?"”</i></p>
			
			<p> The air grows thick with tension, as the spirit’s essence claws at the edges of your
 mind.</p>
 <p>Would you like Brulgwyn to answer, attempt a skill check, or prepare for battle?</p>
			
			<p> With an <b>Insight check of 8,</b> Brulgwyn narrows his eyes at the spectral figure, trying
 to read its emotions or intent—but the being’s expression remains inscrutable. The
 sorrow in its voice could be genuine, or it could be an illusion, a manipulation crafted
 by the lingering magic of the Hollow.</p>
 
			<p>The figure gestures faintly toward the sigils along the path ahead and says:</p>
 
			<p><b>"The path you follow is lined with echoes of what once was. But not all
 truths are buried—some still breathe in shadows."</b></p>
 
			<p>The sigils ahead faintly glow, pulsing like a heartbeat in the darkness.</p>
			
			<p> With a <b>Perception check of 10,</b> Brulgwyn cautiously surveys the corridor ahead. The
 glowing sigils etched into the stone walls continue to pulse with a faint amber light,
 guiding him deeper into the Hollow Heart. Though the path remains dim, he notices:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li> Faint boot prints in the dust—old and barely visible—suggesting someone walked
 this way long ago.</li><br>
				<li> The sigils seem to react subtly to his presence, flickering ever so slightly when he
 steps near them.</li><br>
				<li> A chill lingers in the air, and the sound of distant whispers rises and falls, as if the
 very stones hold memories of the past.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p> The way ahead curves into a larger chamber, and the pulsing light seems to intensify
 slightly as he approaches. Something lies beyond—something old, sacred, and bound
 to the curse.</p>
		
			<p>Brulgwyn tightens his grip on his warhammer and steps into the larger chamber
 beyond the sigil-marked corridor.</p>
			
			<p> The room opens wide, its high, arched ceiling held aloft by blackened stone pillars
 carved with dwarven runes long faded by time and decay. At the center stands a
<b> massive stone basin,</b> glowing faintly with the same amber hue as the sigils.
 Suspended above it, held in midair by unseen magic, is a <b>twisted root,</b> pulsing darkly
 —its tendrils coiled and writhing like veins of shadow. This is undoubtedly the<b> Heart
 of the Root of Withering.</b></p>
			
			<p>Surrounding the basin are <b>four statues</b> of dwarven clerics, each holding a relic: a
 hammer, a scroll, a chalice, and a flame. The air is heavy with ancient power, and the
 whispers Brulgwyn heard earlier now form <b>fragmented chants,</b> like prayers fractured
 by time.</p>
			
			<p> Suddenly, a deep, echoing voice fills the chamber—not from a figure, but from the root
 itself:</p>
			
			<p><b> "Bearer of Thramdor... why do you trespass in the Hollow Heart?"</b></p>
			
			<p>The root pulses, awaiting Brulgwyn’s answer.</p>
			
			<p><i> Brulgwyn says " I came here to find a cure for my 
people of my town, I came here with no harm but with peace"</i></p>
			
			<p>The chamber seems to hold its breath.</p>
			
			<p> The pulsing root quivers, and the voice returns—quieter this time, as if sifting through
 Brulgwyn’s soul:</p>
			
			<p><b> “Peace... is rare among those who seek power. But you carry not ambition—
 only burden.”</b></p>
		
			<p>The statues around the basin glow faintly. The cleric with the chalice emits a soft,
 silvery light that flows toward the basin. The tendrils around the root recoil slightly,
 and the chants shift to a more harmonious tone—still eerie, but no longer menacing.</p>
			
			<p> The voice speaks again:</p>
			
			<p><b> “To cure what has been tainted, you must complete the Rite of Four Pillars.
 Each relic must be awakened with truth. Speak the tenets you uphold, and
 we shall see if you are worthy.”</b></p>
			
			<p> The relics—the hammer, scroll, chalice, and flame—now glow dimly, awaiting
 Brulgwyn’s approach.</p>
			
			<p>Which relic will Brulgwyn approach first, and what truth will he offer it?</p>
			
			<p>As Brulgwyn approaches the <b>hammer,</b> the carved statue of the dwarf warrior looms
 before him—weathered but unbroken. The relic itself rests atop a stone pedestal,
 etched with dwarvish runes that flicker faintly in response to his presence.</p>
			
			<p>The voice returns, now resonating from the stone:</p>
			
			<p><b> “This is the Pillar of Strength. Not of muscle, but of purpose. What truth do
 you forge in your heart that grants you the strength to endure?”</b></p>
			
			<p> The hammer glows faintly, awaiting Brulgwyn’s answer. A truthful declaration—
 personal, unwavering—will awaken it.</p>
			
			<p>What truth does Brulgwyn speak to the Pillar of Strength?</p>
			
			<p><i> Brulgwyn speaks " I'm a warrior of  loyalty i feel 
responsible for my own people of my home town, i 
must complete my promise. that i will find the solution 
of this mysterious disease. so then my people could be 
in peace, that  all what i need.</i></p>
