	<hr>
	<p>Brulgwyn nods to the old woman, thanking her for the crucial information. With his
 resolve firm, he heads toward the outskirts of Grimhold, determined to find the woods
 where Eldrin Thornbrew is said to reside.</p>
 
	<p>The road leading out of town is quiet, the sounds of market chatter fading behind him
 as he moves into the rougher terrain. The air grows thicker, and the trees seem to
 press in closer with each step. A chill runs down his spine as the woods loom ahead,
 their dark silhouettes almost beckoning him forward.</p>
 
	<p>As he ventures deeper, the path becomes less defined, and the eerie quiet is broken
 only by the rustling of leaves.</p>
 
	<p>Suddenly, he hears a crack of twigs ahead—something or someone is nearby.</p>
	
	<img src="Brulgwyn (DnD)_01.jpg" alt="Brugwyn" width="1180" height="777">
	
	<p>With a <b>6</b> on your Stealth check, Brulgwyn attempts to move silently through the
 underbrush, but his efforts fall short. The leaves crunch beneath his boots, and a low
 branch snaps as he shifts, betraying his position.</p>

	<p>The noise ahead suddenly halts, and a voice calls out from the shadows.</p>
 
	<p>“Who's there? Come out, now.”</p>
 
	<p>It’s a gruff, weathered voice, though there’s a trace of curiosity mixed with caution.
 Brulgwyn’s cover is blown.</p>
	
	<p>Brulgwyn steps out from the shadows, his posture steady and calm, trying to exude
 confidence despite the situation. He speaks with a deep, measured voice, "I’m
 Brulgwyn Burrowbranch. I seek Eldrin Thornbrew. I’ve come for help."</p> 
	
	<p>The figure steps forward from the shadows—a tall, rugged man dressed in furs, his
 face covered by a hood. His eyes narrow as he examines Brulgwyn. “Eldrin don’t take
 kindly to strangers,” the man grunts. “And not many make it out of these woods. You
 sure you’re ready for this?”</p>
 
	<p>The air is tense, but the man doesn’t immediately show hostility. It’s clear he’s testing
 you</p>

	<p>With an <b>18</b> on your Deception check, Brulgwyn’s words come across with surprising
 conviction and sincerity. The man seems to relax, his suspicion fading just a bit as he
 nods.</p>
 
	<p>"Village problems, huh?" he mutters, his eyes still scanning you closely. "Well, I won’t
 stop you. But know this—Eldrin’s no healer. Not in the way you think. He’s a man of...
 peculiar ways. If you want his help, you’ll have to prove you’re worth his time."</p>

	<p> He gestures toward the deeper woods. “Follow the path ahead. It’ll lead you to him,
 but... you’ll have to face the trials first. You can’t just ask for a cure like it’s a coin in your pocket.”</p> 

	<p>He steps back into the shadows, disappearing without a word</p>
	
	<p>Brulgwyn steps forward, following the winding path deeper into the woods. The trees
 grow denser, their branches twisting overhead to form a canopy that blocks out much
 of the daylight. The air grows colder, the scent of damp earth and moss filling his
 lungs.</p> 
	
	<p>The path becomes more rugged, with jagged rocks jutting out and vines wrapping
 around the trunks of trees. The deeper Brulgwyn goes, the quieter it becomes, save
 for the occasional rustle of animals in the underbrush.</p>
	
 <p>Soon, he reaches a clearing where a strange structure stands—an old, weathered
 stone altar, overgrown with ivy and moss. At its base, there’s a flickering green flame
 dancing within a stone brazier, its eerie glow casting shadows across the clearing.</p>
 
	<p>A voice suddenly speaks from the darkness, sharp and clear. “You’ve come... but are
 you prepared?”</p>

	<p> A figure steps out from behind the altar—a tall man, pale and gaunt, with wild,
 untamed hair and eyes that gleam with unsettling knowledge. His voice carries a
 weight of authority. “Eldrin Thornbrew at your service.” </p>
	
	
	<img  src="the old wizerd.jpg" alt="the old man" width="1336" height="786">
		
		

	<p>Brulgwyn steps forward, his voice steady and firm. “I am Brulgwyn Burrowbranch, a
 warrior from Grimhold. My people are dying from a mysterious flu, and I seek your
 help to find a cure. The village is in peril, and I have been told you may have the
 knowledge I need.”</p>
		
	<p>Eldrin Thornbrew's piercing eyes never leave Brulgwyn’s face as he listens. He doesn’t
 speak for a moment, his gaze studying the dwarf. Finally, he nods slowly. “The flu you
 speak of... it is not of natural origin, is it?”</p>
	
 <p>He moves closer, his long fingers brushing the edge of the brazier. “I know of this
 ailment. And I also know that curing it will not be simple. To find what you seek, you
 must pass the trial—only then will I decide whether or not I can assist you.”</p>
 
	<p>The green flame flickers in the brazier, casting strange shadows around the clearing.
 Eldrin’s expression turns more serious. “But know this: not all trials are won with
 strength. Some require more than what a warrior can offer.”</p>

	<p>With a <b>6</b> on your Insight check, Brulgwyn struggles to gauge Eldrin’s true feelings. The
 man’s expression is difficult to read, and his demeanor remains calm, almost
 unreadable. He doesn’t give off any immediate signs of hostility, but there’s
 something unsettling about his quiet, cryptic nature.</p>

	<p>It seems you won’t be able to get a clear sense of whether the trial is a genuine
 challenge or something else entirely</p>

	<p>Eldrin’s lips curl into a faint, knowing smile as Brulgwyn accepts the trial. “Very well.
 Your determination will be tested.”</p>
 <p>He steps aside, gesturing to the altar and the flickering green flame. “The trial is not
 of the body, but of the spirit. You must prove your worth by confronting the very thing
 that haunts you—your greatest fear. Only then will you earn the right to ask for what
 you seek.”</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, the green flame in the brazier flares up brightly, casting a
 strange, ghostly glow around the clearing. The air grows thick with tension, and the
 world around Brulgwyn begins to warp and shift.</p>
	
	<p>Before he can react, the ground beneath him trembles, and a haunting voice echoes in
 the air, distorted by an unnatural force. “Face your fear, warrior. Only then will you be
 free.”</p>
 
	<p>The shadows around Brulgwyn stretch and twist, forming into shapes—creatures,
 memories, or something else entirely.</p>
