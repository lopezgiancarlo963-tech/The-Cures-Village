			<h1>CHAPTER 12</h1>
			<h2>The Curse Roots</h2>
		</header>
		<main>
			
			<hr>
			<p> Brulgwyn plants his boots firmly, grips the edge of the concealed seam, and with a
 grunt that echoes off the stone walls, he heaves. The muscles in his arms and back
 strain, and with a grinding <b>crack,</b> the hidden door shifts, stone scraping against stone.
 Dust bursts from the edges as a narrow gap opens<b>—just wide enough to squeeze
 through.</b></p>
			<p> Behind the door lies a <b>dark, narrow passage.</b> The air that escapes is damp and cold,
 carrying a faint metallic tang<b>—blood? iron? something older.</b></p>
			<p> Somewhere down this passage, the curse may yet pulse in its root.</p>
			<p>Brulgwyn narrows his eyes, adjusts his grip on the warhammer, and steps into the
 passage, every footfall deliberate, careful not to trigger any hidden dangers. The walls
 here are smoother, unnaturally so—as if worn down not by time, but by use. Faint
 etchings line the sides, nearly erased by age, symbols reminiscent of ancient dwarven
 runes... but twisted.</p>
			<p>After a few cautious minutes of descent, the passage opens into a <b>low, circular
 chamber</b> lit by a faint, <b>pulsing blue glow</b> emanating from veins in the stone floor. In
 the center lies a dais with a cracked pedestal, upon which sits a small stone basin
 filled with <b>black ichor,</b> pulsing in time with the glow.</p>
			<p> Suddenly, a whisper slithers through the chamber in a language Brulgwyn doesn’t
 understand—but <b>he feels it</b> in his bones. It speaks of hunger, roots, and promises
 broken.</p>
			<p> Brulgwyn's voice rises like a thunderclap in the chamber, his warhammer lifted high as
 he <b>calls out boldly,</b> daring whatever presence lurks to show itself.</p>
			<p><i> ““I am Brulgwyn Burrowbranch, son of the stone and oath-bound to save my kin!
 Show yourself, or cower in the dark!””</i></p>
			<p>Your voice echoes through the stone corridor with the weight of ancestral fury, and the
 very air seems to quiver.</p>
			<p> There’s a moment of silence—then, from the darkness ahead, you hear a low, scraping
 sound. The air grows colder. A shape stirs beyond the torchlight… and <b>a spectral
 figure begins to emerge,</b> faint and flickering like smoke, clad in the remnants of
 ancient dwarven armor.</p>
			<p> It raises a ghostly axe, but does not charge. Instead, it speaks in a hollow voice:</p>
			<p><i>“"The oath you speak… it echoes of truth. But many have lied beneath these halls.
 Prove your honor, Brulgwyn Burrowbranch. Speak the promise that binds your
 soul."”</i></p>
			<p> You recall the inscription from the stone door:</p>
			<p><i> ““To pass into the Hollow Heart, bear the Root and speak the Promise.””</i></p>
			<p><i> I  as  Brulgwyn Burrowbranch i came a long way to 
save my people in my village by a mysterious  sickness 
that i can't heal or treat, i bag you to please help my 
people of my village. to find the cure of this illness.</i></p>
			<p> As your words echo through the ancient corridor, the spectral warrior’s eyes flash with
 a soft golden light. The silence that follows is deep and reverent. Then, the ghost
 lowers its axe and places its fist over its chest in a gesture of respect.</p>
			<p><i> ““Your promise is true. A vow forged in loyalty and grief… worthy of Thramdor’s
 memory. The path shall open.””</i></p>
			<p> With a grinding rumble, <b>the stone floor ahead shifts,</b> revealing a staircase spiraling
 downward—lit now by a faint, ethereal glow.</p>
			<p> You’ve been granted passage into <b>the Hollow Heart,</b> the buried sanctum said to
 house the <b>Root of Withering—</b>and perhaps, the truth behind your village’s curse.</p>
			<p> You feel a pulse from the amulet of Thramdor at your chest… as if the spirits of your
 ancestors walk beside you.</p>
			
			<p>With resolve burning in your chest, Brulgwyn Burrowbranch steps onto the staircase
 and begins the descent into the <b>Hollow Heart.</b></p>
			
			<p> The air grows colder with each step, thick with age and magic. Faint carvings glow
 along the walls<b>—ancient dwarven runes</b> depicting the rise and fall of your
 ancestors. Some show dwarves crafting wonders, others falling to dark vines and
 shadowy forms. You feel eyes upon you—not hostile, but watchful.</p>
			
			<p> At the bottom of the stairs, you enter a vast circular chamber. In its center stands a
 <b>twisted tree stump,</b> blackened and cracked, its roots embedded deep in the stone
 floor. Tendrils of shadow pulse from it in slow, rhythmic beats<b>—the Root of
 Withering,</b> alive and cursed.</p>
			
			<p> Behind it, an ancient dwarven <b>archway covered in warding glyphs</b> hums faintly.
 You sense <b>power locked away</b> behind it.</p>
			
			<p> Suddenly, a soft voice echoes across the chamber—neither male nor female, but
 resonant and sorrowful:</p>
			<p><i> ““Who dares touch the heart of sorrow? What sacrifice do you bring to end what
 was begun in pride?””</i></p>
			<p> You are not alone here.</p>
			<p>With a <b>gravelly voice,</b> full of both strength and humility, Brulgwyn speaks:</p>
			<p><i> ““I seek no glory, only the salvation of my people. I stand before you not for my
 pride, but for the promise I made to my ancestors. I swear by the stones of my
 village and the memories of those I've lost. My people are suffering, and I would
 carry any burden to end this curse. Please… show me the path to cure them, and I
 will honor your guidance.””</i></p>
			<p>The room falls silent for a moment, the shadows still and unmoving. The ethereal
 presence hums quietly, as if deliberating, weighing the sincerity of your words.</p>
			<p> Then, the voice responds, softer now, but still powerful:</p>
			<p><i>“"Your heart bears the weight of truth, Brulgwyn Burrowbranch. The Root of
 Withering is both curse and cure. It has fed upon sorrow for ages, twisting the world
 as it withers. The only path to healing… is not one of power, but of sacrifice. You
 must face what you fear most—and break the bonds that hold this curse in place."”</i></p>
			<p> The Root pulses once, its shadowy tendrils reaching toward you as if beckoning you
 to come closer.</p>
			<p><i> ““Are you willing to face the shadow within you? To break the curse, you must offer
 what you cherish most.””</i></p>
			
			<p>Brulgwyn Burrowbranch stands tall, heart steady with resolve. He steps forward into
 the heart of the chamber, his hand reaching out toward the Root of Withering. The
 shadows stir around him, each tendril like a whisper of the past—of his people, his
 village, his lost kin.</p>
			
			<p> As you approach, the <b>Root pulsates with dark energy,</b> its presence suffocating but
 undeniable. The <b>shadows twist into forms—</b>not just the lost memories of your
 village, but your <b>deepest fears:</b> the faces of those who have succumbed to the
 illness, the hollowed-out look of your people, staring into oblivion as they fade from
 existence. And there, standing in the darkness, is a twisted vision of yourself—a
 <b>version of you,</b> forsaken by the very promise you made, walking away from your
 village in defeat.</p>
			
		<p> But Brulgwyn, <b>undaunted,</b> steps through the shadows, <b>embracing</b> the fear, the
 doubt, the sorrow. His voice rings clear through the chamber:</p>
		<p><i>“"I will not falter. I face the shadows, the curse, and my own fears. I offer myself to
 free my people."”</i></p>
			
	<p> The shadows recoiling from the Root shift and writhe violently as though they <b>resist</b>
 your determination, but your <b>courage shines through.</b> Slowly, the twisted version of
 yourself dissipates, and the faces of your fallen people fade into the ether.</p>
			
			<p> The <b>Root of Withering</b>shudders, its dark tendrils <b>crumbling away</b> to reveal <b>pulsing golden light</b> at its core. The curse begins to break.</p>
			
			<p>The voice, now calm and distant, echoes once more:</p>

<p><i> ““The path is clear… You have passed the trial. The cure lies within your heart. The
 Root has been undone.””</i></p>
			
			<p> With a final <b>bright pulse of light,</b> the Root turns to ash. A <b>glimmering vial </b>of liquid
 rests where the heart of the Root once was<b>—the cure</b>for the illness that ravages your
 village.</p>
			
			<p> You’ve succeeded. Your journey is one step closer to completion, but the way forward
 is still unclear. The ancient doorway behind you pulses, the path now open.</p>
